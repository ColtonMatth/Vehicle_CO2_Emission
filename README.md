## About Dataset

The dataset contains information on:
- Vehicle make, model, and class
- Engine size, number of cylinders, transmission, and fuel type
- Fuel consumption (city, highway, combined)
- **Target:** CO‚ÇÇ emissions (g/km)

---

## SQL Data Preparation & Queries

The project uses SQL within the notebook to:
- Identify makes/models with the highest and lowest CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- Find the most fuel-efficient vehicles
- Compare emissions by fuel type and vehicle class
- Analyze trends between engine size and emissions
- Explore hybrid vehicle offerings and their emissions

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA includes:
- Distribution plots for CO‚ÇÇ emissions and engine size
- Categorical analysis of vehicle class and fuel type
- Bivariate analysis (e.g., engine size vs. emissions)
- Correlation matrix to identify key drivers of emissions

---

## Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- **Train-Test Split:** Ensuring robust model evaluation
- **Model Selection:** Random Forest Regressor chosen for its performance and interpretability
- **Model Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV

---

## Model Evaluation & Deployment

- **Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ are used to assess model performance
- **Deployment:** The best model is saved with `joblib` for future predictions

---

## Key Insights

- Engine size, fuel consumption, and vehicle class are major drivers of CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- SQL queries provide rapid, actionable insights for both business and technical audiences
- The tuned Random Forest model delivers accurate predictions
